This is a Go tool that mocks the basics of Ethereum 1.0 RPC server for usage as an endpoint for Ethereum 2.0. Created by the Prysmatic Labs team, building a production client for Ethereum 2.0 called [Prysm](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm). **WARNING**: This is _NOT_ a generic Ethereum mock RPC server, as it's only purpose is to serve Ethereum 2.0 clients.

### Why do we need this?

Ethereum 2.0 is an entirely new blockchain protocol which will bring much needed scalability and security upgrades to the current Ethereum ecosystem. Contrary to being a hard fork, Ethereum 2.0 will be a separate system built from scratch running [Proof of Stake](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ) consensus. Participants in consensus are known as **validators**, and they join the network by depositing 32 ETH into a **validator deposit contract** deployed on the current Ethereum Proof of Work chain. Nodes running Ethereum 2.0 need to listen to these deposit contract events in order to kick-off the chain and onboard new validators.

This project serves as a mock server that simulates that deposit functionality without the need to run a real Ethereum network, making it easier to run local testnets for Ethereum 2.0. It is meant to be used alongside an Ethereum 2.0 client such as [Prysm](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm).

## Installation

To run the tool, you'll need to install:

  - The latest release of [Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html)
  - A modern GNU/Linux operating system

### Build the Mock ETH1 RPC Server
#### Native
1. Open a terminal window. Ensure you are running the most recent version of Bazel by issuing the command:
```
bazel version
```
2. Clone this repository and enter the directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/eth1-mock-rpc
cd eth1-mock-rpc
```
3. Build the project:
```
bazel build //...
```
Bazel will automatically pull and install any dependencies as well, including Go and necessary compilers.

#### Docker
```
docker build -t eth1-mock-rpc .
```

## Running the Mock ETH1 RPC Server

### Validator Private Keys

You'll need a file of unencrypted validator private keys to use for triggering mock deposits. You can use `unencrypted_keys.json` at the root of this directory for this purpose. You can then run the mock using:

```sh
bazel run //:eth1-mock-rpc -- --genesis-deposits 64 --unencrypted-keys /path/to/unencrypted_keys.json
```

Once your server is running, it will launch an HTTP and websocket listener at http://localhost:7777 and http://localhost:7778 respectively. You can now launch the Prysm project and point it to these endpoints to receive mock data:

#### Native
```sh
bazel run //beacon-chain -- \
--no-discovery \
--http-web3provider http://localhost:7777 \
--web3provider ws://localhost:7778 \
--clear-db \
--verbosity debug
```

#### Docker
```
docker run --rm \
  -v <path-to-unencrypted-keys-dir>:/keys \
  eth1-mock-rpc \
    --unencrypted-keys-dir /keys \
    --genesis-deposits 64 \
    --prompt-for-deposit=false
```
